The best place to start is probably the examples folder. Additional documentation for this library is not yet available
(other than comments in the code), but in the meantime, for an introduction to DCI,
see the article:

"Working with objects - in computer and mind"
at http://fulloo.info/Documents/.

Another good (albeit somewhat older) introductory article is:
http://www.artima.com/articles/dci_vision.html

For more articles and information about DCI, see:

And this book by DCI's co-creator, which has a chapter on DCI:
Lean Architecture: for Agile Software Development
James O. Coplien and Gertrud Bj√∏rnvig
